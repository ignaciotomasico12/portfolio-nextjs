I started programming a few years ago, when I graduated from high school and decided to study a higher degree in Computer Networks. There, I learned the basics of web programming with HTML and CSS. Since then, thanks to a colleague and good friend, who taught me almost everything I know about web programming, I have been specializing in various web programming languages. I have been able to participate in various projects in my first job as a web developer, ranging from a mobile application to make reservations for paddle tennis courts to an Intranet.",
